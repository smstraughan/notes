        Purpose:

The purpose of each coding assignment is to help you master the concepts presented each week by answering problems using those concepts.
 

Due Date:

Each Coding Assignment is due by midnight on Saturday.
 

Late Policy:

Assignments turned in late will result in a 10% deduction of points.
 

Tips:

Start the assignment early in the week and before your live class.
Bring questions to your class, to office hours or a mentor session.
Be sure to follow all instructions as there are no resubmissions or regrades.
 

ðŸš¨ Special Notes:

 

For this project and all remaining projects, you should have a file called .gitignore in your project directory. In that file you should have a line that says "/node_modules" without the quotes. This tells git to ignore all your node module dependencies when it pushes code to your repo.
You should also have a file called package.json in your project directory. Please make sure this file gets pushed to your Github repo with all your other project files. This file is a manifest or list of all dependencies that your project requires to function properly. With this file someone can clone your repo and then run "npm install" in the project directory and they will automatically download all the node module dependencies needed.
In particular, the graders will be cloning your repo (using git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName) and then installing all the dependencies (using npm install). They can then test your project locally on their machine. It is recommended you run these commands at least for this project to make sure you can clone and run your project locally. If you have trouble doing that, please ask for help before submitting it.
 

 

MacOS Users:

 

If you run into permissions errors when installing http-server you may need to run the command like this: sudo npm install -g http-server
At which point you will be prompted for your password. 
Go ahead and enter your password (even though it looks like nothing is happening)
Press enter.
Still running into an issue?

 

You can also utilize the live-server extension as an alterative should you run into issues installing http-server. Click the extensions icon in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and search for live-server to install it.
 

Instructions:

 

In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
Create a .gitignore file containing the text: node_modules
Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository.
Create a Video showcasing your assignment.
Keep Track of the URLs for this week's GitHub repository and Video upload.
Submit both URLs in the Submission Text Box on this page!
 

Coding Steps:

 

Create a new website using HTML and Bootstrap. 
The website must include the following:
At least 2 pages.
A Bootstrap navbar, table, and form.
Bootstrap grid used throughout to format elements
Elements should stack vertically when the window is small
 

Video Steps:

 

Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
This will create a video recording on your computer.
This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
 

Submission Text Box Format:

 
GitHub Repository URL: https://github.com/my_github_user_name/repository_name_here

 
Video URL: https://youtu.be/YNWjLha5x3o
